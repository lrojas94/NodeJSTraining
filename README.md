### TEMPLATES CHARACTERISTICS:
* Handlebars: Great and really similar to lots of template engines for PHP. The problem with it though is that is uses {{}} and that's something angularJS uses too, hence why I'm not using it.
* Jade: Too complex to use in general. Differs a lot from actual HTML.
* EJS : Doesn't mess with Angular. Uses <% %> as enclosing brackets, which I hate, but that will have to do in case I'm using AngularJS.
